# WreckFaceApp
Whole project was for educational purpose which I used for master's thesis.

App was developed in Android Studio with [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/) and [JavaCV](https://github.com/bytedeco) libraries.

Gender and Age Recognition was implemented through deep neural networks and pretrained Caffe model by [Gil Levi and Tal Hassner](https://gist.github.com/GilLevi/c9e99062283c719c03de). 

Face Recognition is based on LBPH face recognizer which can be found in JavaCV.
